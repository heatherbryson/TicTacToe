# TicTacToe 
In this exersise Tic-Tac-Toe game with React, we practice synchronizing state between parent and child components so the board can keep track of each square in the game and each square can keep track of whose turn it is.

##
How to Run
To run this project, download the files locally to the same directory. Open in terminal and run the path "http-server -c-1". Go to your local host to run application. 

## Roadmap to Future Improvements
I'd like to add a feature that puts a line through the winning play and make the winning announcment pop up on the screen. I'd also like to add a component that changes the color of the squares based on who's play it is. (i.e. Player one has black squares, player 2 has orange squares).
